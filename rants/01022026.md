What a waste of a day today was and by no means was this about chasing productivity voodoo shit. Lazily woke up with no plans for the day, so what does an unplanned person do? Search for and create to do's. To be honest, I already have a shit ton of things == GATE, modding apps (don’t ask me why, I don’t even know how), looking into Linux OS, blah blah blah.

Anyway, fuck it. I started looking into some Harvard free course on data science. Fun fact: **data science is an umbrella term**, it encompasses machine learning, statistics, data cleaning, and I don’t even know what else. On god, why is it so hard to register for a free course? Why can’t they just make a button saying *“here, start the course”*? All I see is **“pay up”**. Bruh, what do you mean!!? this is a free course (the certification is paid, unless specified otherwise). I couldn’t even find the register button. Maybe I was just sleepy.

Left it for another day.

Then I started trying to understand the Linux installation process, especially **Arch**. Questions like:

- **ISO (image)** — basically a snapshot of the OS, kind of like frozen food  
- **Booting**  
- **Firmware** — software embedded into hardware components that tells them what to do and how to operate; something more reflexive and involuntary when compared to humans == breathing, heartbeat  

How do they even do that?

And guess what?! I got distracted. Went to YouTube to check this and somehow a crazy shit idea hit me.

**Let’s create Alexa.**  
Wow damn. Lol.

This single thought ruined the entire day.

So, prerequisites:

- Speakers  
- A phone or something computer-like which doesn’t have a peanut-sized brain  
  (idk if you can do it on Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.)

I have an old **Redmi Note 4**.

Before I could do anything meaningful with this idea, I sat down and watched *Dhurandhar* :D the whole **3 hours 25 minutes**. Beautiful time utilization, yay :)

After some Dhurandhar time, I finally sat down to get on with the idea.

**My obstacles:**

- Forgot password  
- Fuck MIUI  
- Fuck MIUI  
- Fuck MIUI  
- Fuck MIUI  

After a hellish battle, I reset the password. Came across a recommendation to install LineageOS idk, because it was going to add zero value to this project. Following that, I went down the MIUI unlock rabbit hole: add Mi account and device, fastboot, etc etc.

**My obstacles (again):**

- Couldn’t get into recovery mode  
- Fuck MIUI  
- Fuck MIUI  
- Fuck MIUI  
- Fuck MIUI  

Guess what?! it wasn’t helping shit. Couldn’t even get into TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project). And now we’re back to the roots :) just use Google Assistant, connect it to a speaker, and sleep.

Good night.
