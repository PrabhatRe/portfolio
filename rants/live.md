> **“There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.”** - *Albert Camus*

What is *that* driving people to live?  
Where are people running?  
What kind of race is this?  
How long do I have to run?  
Am I even running?  
Where even am I?

&nbsp;

*Am I alive?*

&nbsp;

To scavenge for dreams and purpose just to survive—  
how pitiful can a life be?

Dreams taken.  
Purposes predefined.  
Everything feels pointless.  
Every action feels inconsequential.  
Everything feels saturated to the point it feels soulless.

&nbsp;

I yield.

&nbsp;

A toddler won’t stop exploring  
just because another toddler already did.

&nbsp;

I want to run amok,  
walk untrodden paths,  
swim across the routes of sailors,  
unbound by the chains of necessity.

The shackles of necessity are daunting and unforgiving.  
We learn how to survive so well  
that we forget how to live.

&nbsp;
